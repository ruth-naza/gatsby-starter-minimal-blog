Welcome to another Episode of Coder Chic. On this episode ..... what am I doing right now?ðŸ˜¶
Moving on! So I will be explaining react while working on my typing skills (horrible at the moment ðŸ’©)
First off, I'd be talking about the origin of react.

#### Origin
On the 29th of May 2013, React made open source by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. It was
developed two years ago on Facebook's Newsfeed. Let's skip the history lesson and move on to the what, whys and
hows.

#### What is React?
React is an open-source frontend JavaScript library which is used for building user interfaces especially for
single page applications. It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps.

#### Features.
* It uses VirtualDOM instead RealDOM considering that RealDOM manipulations are expensive.
* Supports server-side rendering.
* Follows Unidirectional* data flow or data binding.
* Uses reusable/composable UI components to develop the view.

So having gone through a lot of tutorials, Here are my pros and cons.

#### PROS.
* Using a VirtualDOM makes the page faster since the VirtualDOM (the abstract copy of the RealDOM created by react)
takes the changes made to the RealDOM and updates the webpage with it in real-time.
* The flow of state is uni-directional, states can only be passed from parent to children so it makes the code predictable and stable.
* It's open source. The fact that the code-base is open source gives me confidence that react would last beyond the hype. It has also gotten
a lot of support from other developers in the sense that other applications are being built to extend the functionality of react (like this website).
* It's easy to reuse react components because they are created in isolation.
* It's also easy to change the design using react because a design change in one component automatically updates all instances of the same component.
* I don't know too much about redux yet(because I spent a lot of time on react) but I can see how state management would make my life a whole lot
easier since learning the technicalities of state took me such a long time.SO THERE REDUX ðŸ˜ª

#### CONS.
* Development is too fast! Slow down Facebook! Still learning here!
* Documentation is quickly becoming outdated. I can't count how many times i got an error in my console while going through tutorials 3 months earlier
because the methods I used had become outdated. I had a whole rant blogpost because of this! See it [here](https://coderchic.netlify.com/my-reaction-to-react).
* It takes a while to get used to the html syntax in JavaScript even though I know it's for a good cause. Seperation of concerns is a pro, syntax is a con. I know
we can't have it all, but we can try!

I'm tired of typing at 17wpm so I'm just going to stop here. Part 2 coming soon.

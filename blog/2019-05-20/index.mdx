Before you judge the title too quickly ðŸ˜Š. Disclaimer -> I'm not very good at subject lines.

I decided to take react very seriously and here is what I understand from the documentation. It's
a well thought out Library and the documentation is very explanatory. But things change fairly quickly
and I saw ```componentWillMount()``` become obsolete. I understand that its has a lot of support which
is great for someone like me who is just starting out with learning the library but I don't want to
unlearn stuff as soon as I've learnt them. Hopefully, tommorow I'd be talking about what I learnt so far
and how that will help me build a web application pretty soon. ðŸ˜‰
